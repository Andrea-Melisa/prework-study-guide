          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content show to the user.</li>
          <li>The section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content. </li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor= hyperlink) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>

          <li>Enter your CSS notes here:</li>
          <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. </li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS, you use the style attribute to change color of a heading (h1)</li>
          <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>The external CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>If you want to apply a rule to all the elements visible at the page, add * symbol before the curly bracket.</li>

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git checkout main: switch to the main branch</li>
          <li>git add -A: allows to move changes from the working directory to the stage area (stage your changes)</li>
          <li>git commit -m "your message here": Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: Once the changes are added and committed locally, make sure the local branch is up to date before pushing up the changes. Pull in the base branch main to your feature branch feature/add-XX </li>
          <li>git push origin feature/add-XX: push up your changes to the remote repository</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). </li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li> 
          <li>The location of the data item in an array is called index (location number) and it starts from 0.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. A function's name is followed by parentheses (). The code to be executed is written inside the curly brackets {}.</li>
          <li>Declaring a function does not mean that the code will automatically execute. We need to call the function in the code at the spot we want it to execute. To call a function, we use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where we want the code to execute</li>
          <li>To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
