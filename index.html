          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content show to the user.</li>
          <li>The section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content. </li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor= hyperlink) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>

          <li>Enter your CSS notes here:</li>
          <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. </li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS, you use the style attribute to change color of a heading (h1)</li>
          <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>The external CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>If you want to apply a rule to all the elements visible at the page, add * symbol before the curly bracket.</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git checkout main: switch to the main branch</li>
          <li>git add -A: allows to move changes from the working directory to the stage area (stage your changes)</li>
          <li>git commit -m "your message here": Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pull the latest changes. Pulls in the base branch main to your feature branch feature/add-XX </li>
          <li>git push origin feature/add-XX: push up your changes to the remote repository</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). </li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li> 
          <li>The location of the data item in an array is called index (location number) and it starts from 0.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. A function's name is followed by parentheses (). The code to be executed is written inside the curly brackets {}.</li>
          <li>Declaring a function does not mean that the code will automatically execute. We need to call the function in the code at the spot we want it to execute. To call a function, we use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where we want the code to execute</li>
          <li>To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
